## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a distracted driver detection system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can classify whether a driver in an image is distracted or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle. You can access it at the following link: [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection).

Please make sure to download the dataset and follow the instructions to prepare the data for training the model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `distracted_driver_detection.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model development, training, and testing.
- `project_image.jpg`: An image representing the project (you can replace it with a suitable image).
- `output.csv`: This file contains the predictions made on the test data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter notebook, ensure you have the following libraries and tools installed:

- Python 
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (or an equivalent environment)

## Instructions

1. Download the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset from Kaggle using the provided link.
2. Extract the dataset and organize it according to the project requirements.
3. Open the `distracted_driver_detection.ipynb` notebook in your Jupyter environment.
4. Execute the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
5. The predictions will be saved to the `output.csv` file.

## Results

The model's training and validation accuracy and loss are visualized in the notebook. You can use these metrics to assess the performance of the distracted driver detection model.
